Only she don't know it yet
I got a six string best friend
Who sleeps with a broken neck
I want to make my mark
Change the world, with this flow
But, all this doubt in my head
It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to lock my door and shut out all the world surrounding me
Safe from the problems and the pressures caused by insecurities

Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll!
Get up! Get up!
Take my heart and my soul!
Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
On and on and on

Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives
Come on and let me go
And just like everyone else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

I got a heartache
She's my insecurity
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me
I want to breakout, carpe diem,
I know, but all this doubt in my head It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to find my own direction on this busy one-way street
Where all the influential people never bother helping me

Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
Get up! Get up!
Take my heart and my soul!
Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
One and on and on

Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives
Come on and let me go
And just like everyone else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

This is the anthem
Out to all the misfits
If you feel you don't belong
If you don't give a shit
About authority
About majority
About conformity
Shout it out
Let us go!
Let us go!
Let us go!
Let us go!
Let us go!
Let us go!
Let us go!

Everyone else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives
Just like everyone else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives
Just like everyone else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives"

On a Holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!
Heartbeat, heartbeat

Don't bother to pack your bags
Or your map
We won't need them where we're goin'
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay

Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a Holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!
Heartbeat, heartbeat

We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
On the road with Kerouac
Sheltered in Bivouac
On this road we'll never die...

Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a Holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!
Heartbeat, heartbeat"

With my momma's mason jar
Caught a lovely Butterfly

When I woke up today
And looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
But everytime I pin down what I think I want
It slips away - the ghost slips away

I smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch

I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
A life of chasing Butterfly
I told you I would return
When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never comin' back
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

I thank you for coming into my theatre of fear
Welcome to the show, you're all witnesses you see
A privileged invitation to the last rights of me

Remember me? You can't save me
Mama you never needed me
No crimson king, look in my eye, you'll see
Mama I'm lonely, it's only me, only me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes, of a million

I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed
The idol of a million lonely faces look at me
Behind the mask of sorrow, four doors of doom behind my eyes
I've got their footprints all across my crimson mind

Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live

There is no love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love, to shelter me, only love, love set me free
I was the warrior, with an anthem in my soul
The idol of eight thousand lonely days of rage ago
And remember me when it comes your time to choose
Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true

Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy
The strap on my back
Red, crimson red, no I was never to be
Only one crimson son, no it never was me

Living in the limelight little did I know
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed
But the dream became my nightmare and no-one could hear me scream
With these six-strings, I make a noose
To take my life, it's time to choose
The headlines read of my suicide, of my suicide

Oh sweet silence, where is the sting
I am no idol, no crimson king
I'm the imposter, the world has seen
My father was the idol, it was never me
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes

No love, to shelter me, only love
Love set me free
No love, to shelter me, only love
Love set me free"

And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you

Do you think you love me?

Hoping what you need is behind every door
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all

The feeling sometimes wishing you were someone else
Feeling as though you never belong
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
I truly understand, please don't cry now

Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you, please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you

Being like you are, well, this is something else
Who would comprehend? But some that do lay claim
Divine purpose blesses them, that's not what I believe
And it doesn't matter anyway

A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Or maybe to the last but I'm still not sure
But what I do know is to us the world is different
As we are to the world, I guess you would know that

Please don't go, I want you to stay

A few years back tryin' to make me a buck
Like everybody else, well you know
Times get hard and well I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roamin' and bummin'
Around, so I started thumbin' my way
Back to my old hometown
You know I made quite a few miles
In the first couple of days, and I
Figured I'd be home in a week if my
Luck held out this way
But you know it was the third night
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely
Crossroads, and as the rain came
Pouring down, I was hungry, tired
Freezin', caught myself a chill, but
It was just about that time that
The lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should of seen me smile when I
Heard them air brakes come on, and
I climbed up in that cab where I
Knew it'd be warm at the wheel
Well at the wheel sat a big man
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210
The way he stuck out a big hand and
Said with a grin ""Big Joe's the name
And this here rig's called Phantom 309""
Well I asked him why he called his
Rig such a name, but he just turned to me
And said ""Why son don't you know this here
Rig'll be puttin' 'em all to shame, why
There ain't a driver on this
Or any other line for that matter
That's seen nothin' but the taillights of Big Joe
And Phantom 309""
So we rode and talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his and
I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
He pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears
Man that dashboard was lit like the old
Madam La Rue pinball, a serious semi truck
Until almost mysteriously, well it was the
Lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me and said ""I'm sorry son
But I'm afraid this is just as far as you go
You see I kinda gotta be makin' a turn
Just up the road a piece,"" but I'll be
Damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he
Threw her in low and said ""Go on in there
Son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee
On Big Joe""
And when Joe and his rig pulled off into
The night, man in nothing flat they was
Clean outta sight
So I walked into the old stop and
Ordered me up a cup of mud sayin'
""Big Joe's settin' this dude up"" but
It got so deathly quiet in that
Place, you could of heard a pin drop
As the waiter's face turned kinda
Pale, I said ""What's the matter did
I say somethin' wrong?"" I kinda
Said with 8a half way grin. He said
""No son, you see It'll happen every
Now and then. You see every driver in
Here knows Big Joe, but let me
Tell you what happened just ten years
Ago, yea it was ten years ago
Out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Where you flagged Joe down, and
There was a whole bus load of kids
And they were just comin' from school
And they were right in the middle when
Joe topped the hill, and could
Have been slaughtered except
Joe turned his wheels, and
He jackknifed, and went
Into a skid, and folks around here
Say he gave his life to save that bunch
Of kids, and out there at that cold
Lonely crossroads, well they say it
Was the end of the line for
Big Joe and Phantom 309, but it's
Funny you know, cause every now and then
Yea every now and then, when the
Moon's holdin' water, they say old Joe
Will stop and give you a ride, and
Just like you, some hitchhiker will be
Comin' by""
""So here son,"" he said to me, ""get
Yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the
House, you see I want you to hang on
To that dime, yea you hang on to that
Dime as a kind of souvenir, a
Souvenir of Big Joe and Phantom 309"""

It always makes me sing

There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a twenty-four hour moon

And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
He's wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the East
Colder then a welldigger's ass
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass

Oceanside it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back
And the orange drive-in the neon billin'
And the theatre's fillin' to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin

Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
And out of state plates running a little late

But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101 don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, signalling with a blink

And the radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block, the engine talks
Whispers home at last
It whispers home at last
Whispers home at last
It whispers home at last
Whispers home at last

And there are diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
It always makes me sing

Feel like I'm in heaven when you're with me
Know that I'm in heaven when you smile,
Though we're stuck here on the ground, I got something that I've found
And it's you.

And I don't have to take no trip to outer space
All I have to do is look at your face,
And before I know it, I'm in orbit around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you,
When I see your constellation, honey, you're my inspiration, and it's you.

You're my north star when I'm lost and feeling blue,
The sun is breaking through the clouds don't you, don't you know it's true?
Honey, all the other stars seem dim around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you,
When I see your smiling face, honey,
I know nothing ever going to take your place, and it's you.

And it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you
And it's you, and it's you, shoo-be-doo, ba-da-da."

And all that really mattered then
Was that I was a man
I guess that our being together
Was never meant to be
And Martha, Martha

When you first took me in 
I had calluses, not sores 
And I'd like to keep them 
So go turn those sheets 
Get back on the street 
There's nothing more I can bring to you 
See I'm scared of the door 
Afraid of the floor 
Well, I'll go and walk right through 
And I'll show you 
Who I've been running from

And it's gone

When you first took me in 
I had calluses, not sores 
And I'd like to keep them 
Oh now your feet 
They know this hard street 
They're like old friends 
You're flat on the ground 
There's no further down 
There's no cots to sleep in 
So come in 
Leave them outside the door 
Tear off the paper 
Tear off the carpet 
Off the floor

Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking

I ain't missing you (missing you)

 There's a message in the wire 
And I'm sending you the signal tonight 
You don't know how desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard to understand 
And it's my heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what my friends say (missing you)

The creature comforts, a house that's warm

Defense is needed

Shatters and dies?

When I came to visit you
That's when I knew I could never
Have you

I knew that before you did
Still I'm the one who's stupid
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never bee n so alive
Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes
And you don't mind, you smile
And say the world doesn't fit with you

I don't believe you, you're so serene
Careening through the universe
Your axis on a tilt , you're guiltless and free
I hope you take a piece of me with you
And there's things I'd like to do
That you don't believe in
I would like to build something
But you never see it happen
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I've ne ver been so alone
And I've, I've never been so alive
And there's this burning
There is this burning
Where's the soul I want to know
New York City is evil

The surface is everything but I could never do that
Someone would see through that
And this is our last time
We'll be friends again
I'll get over you, you'll wonder who I am
And there's this burning
Just like there's always been
I've never been so alone alone
And I've, and I've never been so alive
So alive

I go home to the coast
It starts to rain I paddle out on the water
Alone
Taste the salt and taste the pain
I'm not thinking of you again
Summer dies and swells rise
The sun goes down in my eyes
See this rolling wave
Darkly coming to take me
Home
And I've never been so alone
And I've never been so alive"

There's a shouting match

A silence I can't ignore

Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me
I wonder how's it going to be

Children love to sing but then their voices slowly fade away. 
People always take a step away from what is true, 
That's why I like you around, 
I want you. 
Yeah you do... you make me want you. 
An open invitation to the dance, 
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in, 
No apology because my urge is genuine, 
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine. 
Here I am and I want to take a hit, 
Of your scent and it bit, 
So deep into my soul, 
I want you. 
You do you do, you make me want you. 
Send me all your vampires, 
And I can't get enough, 
And I can't get enough, 
The village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave, 
The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save, 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes, Deeper than bones, 
I want you, 
And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom, 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek, 
but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep, 
There will be no regrets when the worms come, 
And they will surely come. 
You do you do, I want you, 
Send me all your vampires, 
I want you

He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night
He's got to work it all alone

Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain
Now who in the world would have know
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown

Through the rain, the sleet and snow
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul
So the let the cold winds blow
What he doesn't see he doesn't know

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all
He said, watch out for the danger
He said, watch out

The man is a winner for the first time in his life
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter
But if you look closely
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind

And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all

I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then

I think of all the little hopes and dreams,
That lie lifeless and unfilled beneath the soil.
I see an old man fingering his perishing flesh.
He tells himself he was a good man and did good things.
Amused and confused by life's little ironies,
He swallows his bottle of distilled damnation.
People turn around with unseeing eyes.
They're looking for something that doesn't exist.
The world you once knew is being eaten up by rust.
No-one has time for the past, but still, in God they trust.
The future is now, but it's all going wrong.
Bodies good for nothing, but it's to nothing they belong.
People say prayers and some work hard.
If you give them all your money, they'll give you their hearts.
This town ain't going like a ghost town.
It's going like hell....

Lights are blinding my eyes

They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

These look well speckly, bit of green and blue
Threes is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to

It's not my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
Everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start
It's fucked up that a man's life can just be attacked
Watching this morning with a beer
Is much better than relying on
Unknown cunts for mates I was given
That don't have my back
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
But I laid it down telling him to fuck right off chap
Phoned this company out the yellow pages
Told them to take away the TV and fix it quick snap
The next day they took away the TV
Told me they would repair the little bit
That's broken round on the back
I thought that would be that but the next bit was on top
This was where it all started to get a bit out of hand

No one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty

'Cause no one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty

The TV man comes back later, knocks on mine
To say he's found something in the back of the TV
I'm looking at it absolutely speechless, can't quite believe
He's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me
I knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back
But he's trying to tap me up for more money
He says it's not like that and I'm like ""Fuck off and die!""
And stick up my two fingers and one more to make three
He says ""Don't talk to me like that"", and I don't understand
My face is in his face, I tell him I understand perfectly
And he grabs my shirt and I grab his face with my hand
So he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek
Now I'm trying to pull his head down so I can knee it
But he's got my ear
He's twisting it round so much that it's
Really hurting me
And we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head back
Onto the corner of the fridge which is, total agony
Then he gets up and runs out the kitchen, and out of the door
Shouting stuff to me, slams his door, shouting at me
So here I am in my house, drinking on my own settee
Everyone's a cunt in this life, no one's there for me

[Chorus 1]

If I want to sit in and drink super tenants in the day I will
No one's going to fucking tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world?
No, you can't
It's all my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
I sat in the kitchen all fucked off
Imagining over and over what they're all doing behind my back
Dodgy things going on, actions I regretted
Stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
And I felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap
But what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates
And then opting to stay out? It seemed to match
But I told him he could make it up by fixing the TV
He said that's the least he could do to square things flat
I thought that would be that but then the next bit was mad
This is where everything started to all turn back

[Chorus 2]
The end of the something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was

He had to unscrew about fifteen screws
Before he could pull the panel off the back
To get in the fecking thing
But just as he did so, he said he saw something
That slipped inside behind the panel
Down the back of it
Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe
I didn't want to lose the bill in case it was a final warning
So we both tried to get the back off and work out
If there was any more screws to get out
Or if we left any in
And when he looked down the back of the TV his eyes just froze
Before he rammed his hand in, saying, ""No shit!""
He's looking at me absolutely speechless
He can't quite believe what he's trying to pull, out the slip
I get up wondering what he's smiling about
He's shaking his head at this point with, the biggest of grins
I look down the back of the TV and that's where it was
In all its glory?my thousand quid

[Chorus 2]

About two this afternoon the last of the people left my house
'Cause they never stop chatting 'til all the rackets gone
I really feel like things clicked into place at some point
Or maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on
Or maybe it's that I realized that it is true
No one's really there fighting for you in the last garrison
No one except yourself that is
No one except you
You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deeds done
Scott can't have my back 'til the absolute end
'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon
He's gotta make sure he's not lonely, not broke
It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above
I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat
Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun
My jeans feel a bit tight, think I washed them too high
I was gonna be late, so I picked up my pace to run

The oily cave seemed to breathe on him through gravestone jaws
His little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
Somewhere a blue-eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy
Footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the grey cave floor
But not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
So with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
'Why on earth', as he wandered the warmth, 'am I obeying this coin?'

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

Again, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea?
And again the scarier alternative looked like certain death to he
He'd never learnt to skill of swimming - it never occurred to be very easy
And again he winced as he flipped the coin and it twirled to his feet
'How is this sane?' he blamed the coin now aiming for the waves
As he hesitated at the swirl of water as it raged and rained
Blue-eyed girls were waiting and he was drowning in the spray
Blue-eyed girls he should have been acquainted with but for shouting and flailing

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

He finally slugs it back to land feeling chewed-up and foolish
Empties his pockets on the sand spewing a pool each
Staggers back to his dad who's too cool to be
So he says 'why did you have me follow this stupid rule, please?'
To be honest little fellow I'll tell you
I was just as afraid as you
But you said you wanted to get with people and places ever new
And I got a bit scared of the fate of my baby son's future
So I invented a reason to see if you could ever make do
As soon as you appeared behind that rock looking angry at me
I soon realized what a hell of a man you've ended up being
I knew you'd worked out how to swim, which I hadn't had in me
And I stand as a companion of you, proudest a man has ever been

Looking to the left slightly then looking back down the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown. 
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us, I can change and I can grow or we can adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. 
We can even have an open relationship if we must. 
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me. 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity, when they opened up she's lookin down at her feet.

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

So then I moved my hand off and down by my side, shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes.
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies, touched the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh.
Because I can't imagine my life without you and me, there's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing.
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely, please please, I'm begging, please.
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with.
She peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures, by pushing my hand away to my chest from hers.

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

And I'm just standing there.
I can't say a word.
'Cause everything has just gone.
I've got nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation, put my arms around her to try to change what she's saying.
Put my head level with hers so she might engage in.
Look into her eyes to make her listen again, I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' just leave it all now.
'cause you said it would be forever and that was your vow, and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down.
Your well out of order now, this is well out of town.
She pulls away, my arms that are tightly clamped around her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight.
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face, takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

I know in the past I've found it hard to say, telling you things but not telling you straight. But the more I pull on your hand the more you pull away.

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now."

Now the rhymes sayin' rent payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain; that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadel-phi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short ""I want it made"" like Ed; 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark skin thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to

But I know his name, he's called Mr. D

A human skulls is hangin' right 'round his neck
The palms of my hands is clammy and wet

Dancin' with Mr. D, with Mr. D, with Mr. D

Will it be poison, I put in my glass
Will it be slow or will it be fast?
The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night
Hiding in a corner in New York City
Lookin' down a forty-four in West Virginia

I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free

Wearin' black silk gloves and a black silk hat
She looked at me longin' with black velvet eyes
She gazed at me strange, all cunning and wise

Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones
The eyes in her skull was burnin'' like coals
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone
I was dancin' with Mrs. D

In that land across the sea there's a job for you and me
Though our presence there may not be found
We must stay standing there on the battle lines and pray
We must never lay our weapons down
We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer
Many thousands miles away someone shed there blood today
With a heart so true and brave they're gone
To a war that's yours and mine let us join the battle line
With a weapon that will save our home
We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer
And when the planes and tanks and guns have done all that they can do
And the mighty bombs have rained and failed
Still the helpful hand above, on the weapon made of love
And against him none on earth prevail

And the bees are humming
To a frog sat strumming
On a guitar with only one string

I can see them they can't see me
I feel out of sight
I can see them they can't see me
Much to my delight

And it seems worth noting
Water rats were boating
As a lark began to sing
The sounds kept coming
With Jack Rabbit loudly drumming
On the side of a biscuit tin

I can see them they can't see me
I feel out of sight
I can see them they can't see me
Much to my delight

Silver minnows were devising
Water ballet so surprising
A mouse played a daffodil
A mole came up blinking
Underneath an owl who's thinking
How he came to be sat on a hill

I can see them they can't see me
I feel out of sight
I can see them they can't see me
Much to my delight

I know you won't believe me
But I'm certain that I did see
A mouse playing daffodil
All the band was really jumping
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping
I found that I couldn't sit still
I just had to make it with them
Cause they played my kind of rhythm
And the bees hummed in harmony
And the owl played his oboe
Then the frog's guitar solo
It was all just too much for me

I know you won't believe me
But I'm certain that I did see
A mouse playing daffodil
All the band was really jumping
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping
I found that I couldn't sit still"

I've been doing my best
What else can I do?
Is there something I've missed
That will help you through

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

For some short time
For a while you and I were joined to eternity
Then we split in two back tome and you
Like the rain rising from the sea
Rising from the sea
We all can see what we shall be
But knowing's not really controlling
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding
After you'd come and while you're gone
You leave me guessing, it's depressing
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing
So you just have to laugh
When it hurts so much
You're so far away and so hard to touch

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing
If I can come through than so can you
And you will find there's no regretting
Things you want from your life's font
Will never let your spirit roam
Come back to Earth for what it's worth

I took a road I'd never been.
I met a stranger by the way,
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear.

Standing in a slide zone,
Steppin' in a slide zone.

He told me where a river flows,
He showed me how the apple grows.
He told me of a magic stream,
His face was worn but his eyes were clear.

Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.
Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

He went to find a shooting star,
Around the bend, that's where they are.
I went along just for the ride,
Suddenly I began to slide.

Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

The air raced by there was no sound,
We drifted high above the ground.
And then he said you know this place,
And then a smile lit up his face.

Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.
Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

I turned my head and I looked below, Slide zone...
And there was something there I know.
Suddenly I began to fall,
I looked around and tried to call.

Standing in a slide zone,
He had me steppin' in a time zone.
Standing in a slide zone,
Falling through a time zone.

Help me please, I thought I said,
Then something happened in my head.
Music came from all around,
And I knew what I had found.

Standing in a slide zone,
Falling through a time zone.
Steppin' in a slide zone,
He had me falling through a time zone.
Slide zone, slide zone,
Slide zone, time zone."

And find myself a life I could call my own. 
It was always my ambition 
To see Piccadilly, 
Ramble and roam around Soho 
And Pimlico and Savile Row, 
And walk down the Abbey Road. 
So I saved all my money 
And packed up my clothes, 
And I said good-bye to my friends 
And my folks back home. 
And I left for a life of my own. 
I left for a life on the road.

I was little more than a child. 
And I didn't know then 
That the dives and the dens 
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild. 
Mama always told me 
The city ladies were bawdy and bold. 
And so I searched night and day 
To catch a kissable lady, 
But all that I caught was a cold, 
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies 
Didn't notice me walk by. 
Now I've got holes in my shoes 
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.

They're lonely together, when they're not apart
It feels like she's holding on to someone else in the dark.

Lyrics: 
The people asking questions to the people with the answers 
The people with the answers ire the people with the questions 
So the people with the questions asked the people with the answers 
The people with the answers won't tell the people with the questions the answers 

So the people with the questions they ask the people with the answers 
But the people with the answers won't speak to them 
Because the people with the answers give the people with the questions 
just a little bit too hard a time to speak to 

I'm a man who likes to be alone 
I'm a man who likes to think alone 
I don't have too many answers, but I got a whole heap of questions 
I got a whole heap of questions that I won't hide from you 

So low, don't smile you get high [?] 

So the people with the books they went and stood up on the mountain 
To get away from the people with no books 
The people with the books they started reading on the mountain but 
they couldn't see a thing because the sky went dark 
I don't know where the cloud cover came from 
I'm just sitting here rocking on the station 

I don't want to be the type of guy 
who lives alone, reading books, and never eats a pizza pie 
I don't want to be the type of person sitting alone with a book on my own 

With a book on my own 

The people with the questions got together 
with the people with the books and left the people with answers out 
So the people with the answers started to make their way over the hill 
to meet with people with the questions and the people with the books 

And we all live together on a little round ball 
We all sing together when the cuckoo calls 

I'm not the type best living alone 
Could we live together? Well, I don't know.. 

I'm not sitting here giving you a lesson 
So I?ll just keep my mouth shut for the next few minutes 

Can't keep quiet for long 
I'm a human being 
Can't help help singing this song 
I'm a human being 

You won't listen to me 
I'm not an authority 

So the people with the answers met the people with the questions 
and the people with the books sat down 
They finally decided to sit around to talk about their problems 
to see if they come up with some answers to meet the questions 
and some questions to meet the answers 

well, the leaves on the trees are green 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the roads are not very clean 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the food we eat is not very healthy 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the music we make is not particularily good 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the planets sort of revolve around the sun 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the moon is a big ball with nothing on it, and I don't think anyone's ever been there 
[ok, so we're kind of agreed to that, so what are we arguing about? 
Well, I don't know.. 
Ok. so let?s get together and smoke that pizza pie] 

Some people with a pizza pie made me very high 
The people with the questions smile 
And the people with the answers lie 
They lie 

So no pizza for them

Made a grave from hoover bags

She'd knitted him a jumper with dominoes on 
So he wore it everyday in every week 
Pretended to himself that she hadn't really gone 
Pretended that he thought he beard her speak

He felt that he had some sort of grip

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

Where do they all belong?

From his hands as he walks from the grave

Stepping outside, she is free

How could she do this to me?""

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say ""Hello"".

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

Don't you raise the sails anymore.

It's for sure, I've spent my whole life at sea
And I'm pushin' age seventy three;
Now there's only one place that was meant for me:

Oh, to be home again,

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
We're gonna soothe away the rest of our years,
We're gonna put away all of our tears,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.

Slow down, Willie Boy,
Your heart's gonna give right out on you
It's true, and I believe I know what we should do.
Turn the stern and point to shore,
The seven seas won't carry us no more.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
I can't wait to sniff that air,
Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
Hear the sound, Willie Boy,
The Flyin' Dutchman's on the reef.
It's my belief
We've used up all our time,
This hill's to steep to climb,
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
Would-a-been nice just t'see the folks,
Listen once again to the stale jokes,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
I can hear something calling on me

And you know where I want to be
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound

Oh to be home again down in old Virginny
I just want to get my feet back on the ground
Oh to be home again down in old Virginny

I'd love to see my very best friend
They call him Rag-time Willie

I believe old rockin chair's got me(oh to be home again)"

Hold back! In my field of vision.
Hold back! Baby burning, fire.

Bushfire! Bushfire! Bushfire!

Well I'm movin' to the beat of a big bushfire.
I'm dancin' to the beat of a big bushfire,
And the flames are warm and getting brighter.

Well everybody loves to dance around the heat and fire
Oh, lightnin' strike twice.
Hey everybody, bask in the afterglow.  Bushfire!
Naked light shining over my bed, been lying here too long.
I need your arms to take me down, take me to the ground.

But I hold back.  Get away from the heat!
Hold back! In my field of vision.
Hold back! I see smoke, smoke in your eyes.

Bushfire! Bushfire! Bushfire!

Watching autumn leaves falling from the trees
And the birds flying high up in the breeze
And tomorrow it could not rain

Some people live their life, with a violence that's pure and clean

In the corner of a darkened cell, and his pain meant nothing to me

But I was younger then young men never die
When I walked out in the sun, I was strong, clear-minded and blind

Now don't say a prayer for anyone, it doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me questions, it'd just be misunderstood
And if you could step inside me you'd feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes, you'd see what self-deception means

I was younger once, and I created a lie
And though my body was strong, I was self-diluted, confident, and blind

Now show some pity, for the weak of will
Because when we're drinking, we can never be filled
Show some understanding for a lonely fool
Because when I'm drinking, I am out of control

In one false move
Turns herself into a pawn

Sleepy and shaken
And watching while the blury night
Turns into a very clear dawn

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

One false move
And a secret prophecy
Well, if you hold it against her,
First hold it up and see
That it's one side stone
One side fire
Standing alone among all men's desire
They want to know

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

And if you wonder
What I am doing
As I am heading
For the sink
I am spitting out all the bitterness
Along with half of my last drink
I am thinking
Of your woman
Who is crying in the hall
It's like drinking gasoline
To quench a thirst
Until there's nothing there left at all

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

""Walk on the blind side""?
Was the answer to the joke
It's said there isn't a political bone
In her body

She would rather be a riddle
But she keeps challenging the future
With a profound lack of history

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

Do you love any, do you love none,
Do you love many, can you love one,
Do you love me?

And watch while the queen
In one false move
Turns herself into a pawn

Sleepy and shaken
And watching while the blury night
Turns into a very clear dawn

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?"

Till that one day when I stood alone, staring straight in the mirror

I'm gonna fight I'm gonna win - that's right - nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna stop me, nothing's gonna stop me now - cause the feeling's back 

And you gotta love the feeling
I dug my hole too deep, I couldn't admit, I didn't know when to stop
But you can only dig your hole six feet until the dirt comes back to top
I've got a long way left to climb but I'll still look you straight in the eye

Safely hid in coal-sheds (double-locked?)

You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with book markers
That measure what we've lost

Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""

And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me

With political connections to spread his wealth around.
Born into society, a banker's only child,
He had everything a man could want: power, grace, and style.

But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be
Richard Cory.

The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes:
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show.
And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht!
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got.

But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be
Richard Cory.

He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch,
And they were grateful for his patronage and thanked him very much,
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read:
""Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head.""

But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be

She always looks good in red.
Turns around in front of the mirror
And disappears inside of her head.

She wonders if he'll even remember,
She asked him in a casual way.
Just in case he didn't want to go with her,
In that event she knew just what she would say.

She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend,
Even though she only has one or two.
She's always done much better with boys anyway,
So who needs girlfriends?

Pacing nervous across the floor of her bedroom,
Gripping tight the phone in her hand.
Fighting beck the rush of emotions,
And dreaming of just having a man.

[Chorus]
It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But underneath she's a broken girl.
But It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But she will always be a broken girl.

She struggles with an awful decision,
Stay at home or walk in alone.
Her mother does her best to console her,
Her father doesn't know what to say.

Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress.
Holds her head high, then gets in the car.
Tells herself that no one will notice,
Assuming she can make it that far.

On the way she imagines reactions.
Cupped hands whispering into ears.
Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching,
And she's also hoping he won't.

Walking tentative alone up the driveway,
Sees some people smoking off to the side.
She stops and waits until they go back in,
Crosses her fingers and follows behind.

[Chorus]

He'll never get you,
He will never understand.
He'll never get you, you can find a better man.

And if you find it please leave it alone.
With a picture she took of a girl on the subway,
With orange barrettes and the saddest face she's ever known.

As Rachael starts to wonder was it hers to begin with,
Or was the memory from someone else's sleep.
Cause there's a hole in her heart that still harbors a question,
Whose answer just might break it so she's hanging on.
At least it's her to keep.
So I asked her

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all these things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

There's a fleck in her eye that no one ever noticed,
A pretty birthmark for such a beautiful face.
All the men from her past seem to have left her abandoned,
I guess there's some things that you can never erase.

I've seen her play with her hair in a moment of tension,
I've seen her with her guard down ready to cry.
But there's a whole in her heart that still harbors the question,
Whose answer just might break it, still she's hanging on,
Cause no one wants to die.
Then she asked me

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Cause baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you."

But I'm hanging
Do you care

So lay back
Call off the attack
'Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

Hey there you
Way out there could you show me
Just a signal
Or a sign
That after all
All these years that you've known me
And I'm not just killing time

Call off the attack
'Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
But I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

As I lay there late at night
Building castles in the air
Out of alibis and all those little lies
And then I look inside
And pray that I don't care

I don't care

I don't care

Hey there you way out there in the distance"

Across the foyer, ya hear the gather of stampeding feet
One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine
A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin'
Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy
Used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby
Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes
Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it
House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin'
Pillsbury box on the stove in the kitchen

When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain

Young shorties in my hood started hustlin'
Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate
Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit
I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit
You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand
Drinkin, thinkin' of a masterplan
Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got
So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock
And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin'
Morning star Reggie makin' go good with the Grits
Now let's take it back for real
When we used to build at ghetto big wheels
With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on
Girls skippin' rope in the street
The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps
Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat

When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain
Almost drive a man insane
What we could find for
To survive another day
But I said nah"

Lazy days don't let them get you down
Wear your smile
I don't want to see you frown
Don't let them get you down

It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason
To sit around and wait
The world can change in a second so
I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate
And dream and dream

Then we will have - a jolly good time

Him with his dungarees and Rollerblades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down
He liked the wind in his face
He said ?Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said ?No' he said ?That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place'
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said
?I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed'

Me and monkey
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages
Called up escort services and ordered some okie doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores
?Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine
What's up, you better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
?My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye
?I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican
But we got ten itchy fingers
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run
Put your gun down boy
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow"

And feel the moon replace the sun

Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows, and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
As you win
She'll be the Hollywood love
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing this for
Now tell me

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy

Picking up the songs of lures.

You don't want the truth, truth is boring.

Leave the car,
Leave the bad men where they are,

Let the river rock you like a cradle
Climb to the treetops, child, if you're able
Let your hands tie a knot across the table.
Come and touch the things you cannot feel.

And close your fingertips and fly where I can't hold you
Let the sun-rain fall and let the dewy clouds enfold you
And maybe you can sing to me the words I just told you,
If all the things you feel ain't what they seem.
And don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream.

The mocking bird sings each different song
Each song has wings - they won't stay long.
Do those who hear think he's doing wrong?
While the church bell tolls its one-note song
And the school bell is tinkling to the throng.
Come here where your ears cannot hear.

And close your eyes, child, and listen to what I'll tell you
Follow in the darkest night the sounds that may impel you
And the song that I am singing may disturb or serve to quellyou
If all the sounds you hear ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream

The rising smell of fresh-cut grass
Smothered cities choke and yell with fuming gas
I hold some grapes up to the sun
And their flavour breaks upon my tongue.
With eager tongues we taste our strife
And fill our lungs with seas of life.
Come taste and smell the waters of our time.

And close your lips, child, so softly I might kiss you,
Let your flower perfume out and let the winds caress you.
As I walk through the garden, I am hoping I don't miss you
If all the things you taste ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .

The sun and moon both arise
And we'll see them soon through days and nights
But now silver leaves are mirrors, bring delights.
And the colours of your eyes are fiery bright,
While darkness blinds the skies with all its light.
Come see where your eyes cannot see.

And close your eyes, child, and look at what I'll show you;
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes blow you,
And maybe when we meet then suddenly I will know you.
If all the things you see ain
quote t what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .
And you can follow; And you can follow; follow...

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights (Oh I remember)

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights"

And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered
Watching the water

Numb and falling through

Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step by step
How I landed on the island
And how I swam across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may wake to a knife in me
No more breath in my hair
Or ladies' underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed
To a neatly written poem
A heartfelt last line reading
There is no more mystery
It it going to happen my love

It's all in your head she said
Morning after nightmare
You're building a wall she said
Higher than the both of us
So try living life
Instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile
And I'll promise not to leave you

It happened under a rainy cloud
Passing through the dark south
We went into a big house
And slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then
As well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives
And we went off separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
And some long forgotten high school fears
It's all in my head I said
Banging a piano
I've not been so alone I thought
Since kicking in the womb
I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me
Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends
We forget what is flesh blood and bone is human
Turning phone lines to airlines
Unwilling to face
The love is found on the inside not the outside
And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you
And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose
The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom
It's all in my head she read
In her girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself
Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world
And wants only to love you

Not wanting to die out here
Without you"

Oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now, Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
And I will never see the day.
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away.
Oh all I do is just O.K.
All of my nights,
And all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away,
Oh run away now.
O.K. now
Alright.
You can go out and make love to whoever, or whatever you like babe
So I go out and fill my eyes with other women,
Oh they look good to me and I think that I might kiss them,
Oh now it's two a.m. and I'm still stood here waiting,
So I go home and wonder why I bothered going.
Yeah every week turns out the same,
The sun, the wind, the snow, the rain.
Oh no but still sometimes I feel,
Oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now, Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
And I will never see the day.
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away.
Oh all I do is just O.K. 
All of my nights, and all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away.
I can't believe it.
I can't remember your face anymore.
Or the sound of your voice.
Or any touch of your skin,
Is a legend.
By the way,
Did I tell you that I loved you?
Oh if I didn't I'm so sorry.
You know I,
I really,
I really meant to tell you.
It's O.K. there's no need to hurry.
But the bed is full of memories,
Full of memories of you.
Oh I've tried to get them out but,
But there's nothing I can do.
Oh if I knew the moon I'd ask him,
Shine his light in through your window,
And send your body home to me today.
Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
And I will never see the day,
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh all I do is O.K.
All of my nights, 
And all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away,
Run away,

Oh, you didn't do bad
You made it out
I'm still stuck here
Oh, but I'll get out
Oh, yeah, I'll get out

Can't you see the giant that walks around you seeing through your petty lives?
Do you think I do these things for real, I do these things just so I survive

And you know I will survive
It may look to the untrained eye
I'm sitting on my ass all day
I'm biding time until I take you all on

My Lords and Ladies, I will prevail
I cannot fail 'cause I spy

Oh I've got your numbers, taken notes
I know the ways your minds work, I've studied

And your minds are just the same as mine
Except that you are clever swines
You never let mask slip, you never admit to it, you're never hurried
Oh, no, no, no

And every night I hone my plan
How I will get my satisfaction
How I will blow your paradise away away, away
'Cause I spy

And it's just like in the old days
I used to compose my own critical notices in my head
""The crowd gasp at Cocker's masterful control of the bicycle
Skilfully avoiding the dog turd next to the corner shop""

Imagining a blue plaque
Above the place I first ever touched a girl's chest
But hold on
You've got to wait for the best
You see, you should take me seriously

Very seriously indeed.
Cause I've been sleeping with your wife for the past sixteen weeks
Smoking your cigarettes
Drinking your brandy
Messing up the bed that you chose together

And in all that time I just wanted you to come home unexpectedly one afternoon
And catch us at it in the front room
You see I spy for a living
And I specialize in revenge
On taking the things I know will cause you pain
I can't help it
I was dragged up

My favorite parks are car parks
Grass is something you smoke
Birds are something you shag
Take your ""Year in Provence"" and shove it up your ass

Your Ladbroke Grove looks turn me on, yeah
With roach burns in designer dresses
Skin stretched tight over high cheek-bones
And thousands of tiny dryness lines beating a path to the corners of your eyes
And every night I hatch my plan, It's not a case of woman v man

It's more a case of haves against haven'ts
And I just happen to have got what you need
Just exactly what you need, yeah

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
In the midnight hour.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I will come to you
I will come to you
I will take you from this sickness
Dinner parties and champagne
I'll hold your body and make it sing again

Come on sing again, Let's sing again, oh yeah, 'cause I spy
Yes, I spy
I spy a boy
And I spy a girl

I spy the chance
To change the world
To change your world"

Oh, only best friends can

Ooh, hoo, ho ooh

I mean, help you pick out your clothes before we go out? 
Not that you're helpless 
But sometime, sometime those are the things that bein' in love's about

Would you run to me if somebody hurt you even if that somebody was me, yeah 
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be, please

Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening? (If I was your girlfriend)
Maybe you think I'm being a little self-centered 
But I, I said I want to be all of the things you are to me (if I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see 

Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room 
Just because you want to undress? 
We don't have to make children to make love 

And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm 
Your body's what I'm all about 
Can I see it? 
I'll show you 
Why not? 

You can do it because I'm your friend 
I'd do it for you 
Of course I'd undress in front of you 
And when I'm naked, what shall I do? 

How can I make you see that it's cool? 
Can't you just trust me? 
If I was your girlfriend, you could 
Oh yeah, I think so 

Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet 
Would that get you off? 
Tell me what will 
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me? 

Would you let me see you naked then? 
Would you let me give you a bath? 
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh 

And would you, would you let me kiss you there 
You know, down there where it counts 
I'll do it so good, I swear I'll drink every ounce 
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long 
And together we'll stare into silence 

And we'll try to imagine what it looks like 
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like 
Yeah, we'll, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like 
Yeah, we'll try"

Right lookin' smellin' good
Lookin' good Spec and Baby Blue and Pleasure Fool
That's all we got!
Let me drop my top pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda bag of chips
That's all I got
Park outside minglin' wit' my homeboys
Faked out fake hugs leave me alone boy
Plus the candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' cross the street
But on the other hand
Alfalfa Just hit me on my metro
Say a party in the park hard baby let's go
The balla tick no questions asked, so I jumped out the white jag
Smooth like Shaq come her girl!

I got new shoes on the ride (yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutie pie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)

Hello Neil and Buzz, 
I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House
and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made
I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done
For every American this has to be the proudest day of our lives
Because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of man's world
and as you talk to us from the sea of tranquility
it inspires us to redouble our efforts 
to bring peace and tranquility to earth

Idle mind and severed soul
Silent nerves and begging bowl
Shallow haze to blast a way
Hyper sleep to end the day"

She said If you want to talk that's fine with me

But I am good at one thing

But I don't, that's for sure

Now wait a minute baby
I don't want you to go
She said ""Don't get no closer
The answer still is no""

So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked
Acted cool and smooth
Got my hands around her shoulder
Two inches from the move

Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be
So I finally made my move, she just said to me

Beat a frantic pace
And it's not even seven AM
You're feeling the rush of anguish settling
You cannot help showing them in
Hurry up then
Or you'll fall behind and
They will take control of you
And you need to heal the hurt behind your eyes
Fickle words crowding your mind

So
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in
And carry you over to a new morning

Try as you might
You try to give it up
Seems to be holding on fast
It's hand in your hand
A shadow over you
A beggar for soul in your face
Still it don't mater if you won't listen
If you won't let them follow you
You just need to heal
Make good all your lies
Move on and don't look behind

So
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in
And carry you over to a new morning

Fickle visions messing with your head
Fickle, vicious
Sleeping in your bed
Messing with your head
Fickle visions

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family get down!
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

My goal sees the world pass from young to old
Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale

Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

I don't wanna fight about who is the liar

I don't wanna hear about who is the winner

You were on a liquid diet, you were sure you had to try it
And you lost all your pounds
The doctor's on vacation, so you took the medication
And wound up in lost and found
So we took a trip to Paris
'Cause you swore that it would scare us out of our swift decline
All that I remember 'bout those days in that September
Is the merci and the wine

Cut it out, drop it, count me out, baby stop it

Precious time, precious time, precious time
Oh, precious time

You talk on the telephone, long distance to New York or Rome
Some would say you got it made
Your home is like a fortress, no one comes in but the florist
The gardener, and the maid
You call me on the telephone, you say you feel so alone
Too tired to get dressed and get out
First you're happy, then you're sad
Somehow you always hang up mad
Excuse me if I shout

Cut it out, drop it, count me out, baby stop it
Life is too short, so why waste precious time
Life is too short, so why waste precious time
Life is too short, so why waste precious time

At times we'd fight, but that's a-ight
Still, not realizin' we had love, it showed
When we played, no phony charades against
One another, now while I write this song
It's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

[Chorus]
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why

As kids, you're overlookin' death
It didn't seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about, wakin' to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on Saturday's, karate flicks, and like
Ridin' your skateboard, or bicycle
And went as deep as Killa Joe on the corner drinkin' Ripple
Plus, Puerto Rican kids on the block were cool
We got along, we all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A Spanish we were close with, was killed by a car
Shocking, Alberto was hit, on the block and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clockin' him 'cross the street
He just received an award
For Little League baseball like an hour before, plus
He didn't even get to see the summer set in
Dyin' all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinkin' shit like that was mad deep, peep it

[Chorus]

Now when somebody is gone, that's when you realize how close you was
How close you are, like a star
Real deep it takes time to heal
And still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let him know you forgave
But they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
What's left, but attend his wake, believin' if it was you
He'd do it for old time's sake, damn
I'm disturbed, by the news when I was told I was sittin'
Knowin' damn well Boo ain't bullshittin'
My life flashed like big bills of cash
And good times we had, now it's all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take, to the streets, then you die, by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishin' that he still was around
Now he found a spot in my heart, or should I say lobotomy
Mike, know you're trapped inside of me
And every other brother in Bush wick
Who rushed to your side thick, all down with the click
Yeah, God Bless he laid to rest
Call him Mike Boogie, that's what describes the nigga best

[Chorus]

We're born to live
We're born to live
We're born to live
We're born to live

Means everyone talks at the same time 
And liberty just means the freedom to exploit 
Any weakness that you can find 
Turn off the TV just for a while 
Let us whisper to each other instead 
And we'll hope that the Corporate ears do not listen 
Lest we find ourselves committing some kind of treason 
And filed in the tapes without rhyme, without reason 
While they tell us that it's all for our own protection,

While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful all in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden was all you were needing
When you still believed in me
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle for me

Her sister and mother and 500 families
And will she remember me 50 years later
I wished i could save her in some sort of time machine

Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are

For ourselves inside some strangers stomach

I can almost hear my mother
Callin', ""Neil, go find your brother
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper

Racin' up two flights of staircase
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace
And his whiskers warm on their face
Where's it gone
Oh, where's it gone

Two floors above the butcher
First door on the right
Life filled to the brim
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads

I can still recall
The smell of cookin' in the hallways
Rubber drying in the doorways
And report cards I was always
Afraid to show

Mama'd come to school
And as I'd sit there softly crying
Teacher'd say, ""He's just not trying
He's got a good head if he'd apply it""
But you know yourself
It's always somewhere else

I built me a castle
With dragons and kings
And I'd ride off with them
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads

Thought of going back
But all I'd see are strangers' faces
And all the scars that love erases
But as my mind walks through those places
I'm wonderin'
What's come of them

Does some other young boy
Come home to my room
Does he dream what I did
As he stands by my window
And looks out on those
Brooklyn Roads"

We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room

So far from where we used to be

When I think of what I've done all the pain that I've brought
Baby, you should have walked out on me
And when I've turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me

And if it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should have been better to you

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Never gave you my heart 'cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt when deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need

And I always gave you up whenever I saw
Something better come along
And right when I come back you're waitin' for me
And you welcome me home

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

And if it takes my whole life I'll make it up to you
'Cause I've been so cruel
And you've given your love to me in spite of everything
I-I don't deserve you

From this day forward I'm truly yours
But it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for loving me

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me

If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another planet
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door and, again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you still got your words and you got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder work another way

Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?

I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave

I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside water like air was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand

I know that starting over's not what life's about

When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Crystal clear it becomes

Let me know

The yearning that I do

All I know
Is that I need a love
To give me what I need

Or hesitate
I'm tryin' to make you see
How it's gotta be

For now I have learned
Lonely tears
They fall the same
When love is not returned

You feel your heat go there 
So close your eyes and you may find that 
Fireflies were as bright as stars; 
Close your eyes and remember 
Summertime lingered on and on 
Close your eyes and remember 
Your first love made the world stand still 
Close your eyes and remember 
Close your eyes and remembers when

Bubbling along the stream 
Sighing sweetly through the hollow

If simon says be glad today
I surely do what simon say
And if youl like to see me smile
Then you're in luck cause that's my style

My pretty bird up in the tree
I hear the song you sing for me
The sky's fantastic blue or grey
And here we are alive today

Hey...
The simple things
The lovely simple things
The sunset and the dawn
The simple things
The lovely simple things
I could go on and on and on

For the simple pleasures
Are worth more than treasures
That your paper money ever bring

This song is old, this song is new
This song is me, this song is you
I like to play out in the rain
I like the sun to shine again
And again and again

Each day so many things to see
And I'm so glad I am me
And you, my friends, are pretty too
And I'm so glad that you are you

And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me

What do I see? what do I see?

I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the lord inside of everyone
Can it be my dream will really come
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

And here comes the morning sun
I wonder if my dream will really come
As I site on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh

And the sun was brighter than it's ever been

And there was so much left to dream and so much time to make it real

They said he crashed and burned
I know I'll never learn why any boy should die so young

And corroded by failure and envy and hate

Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone So
Many threats and fears, so many wasted years before my life became my own

Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind and then he pulls me back

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
And she always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said, Caution! Kids At Play!

Those were the rights of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage, she used my body just like a wound

The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player

""This is not goodbye,"" she said,
""It's just time for me to rest my head.""
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you've put me through

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love

The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her Golden Heart
You found your Golden Heart 

Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
to some Arcadian band
I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
Just to hold time in my hand 

And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your Golden Heart
I'd hold your Golden Heart

Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart

And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep 

And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me

Who want their own tattoo

Laid my hand upon your spine

I see the picture that we made

They like to get me off the pier
And I dream I'm on a steamer
Pullin' out of here

Your presence's more than I can handle
It's come to the point where I wonder if I
Could ever be luckier when

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good
As good as we are
Do you remember?
Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry under the surface?

Lend me your ears, I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real
By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels

Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words
I'm worried she's still on your mind

Mmm... I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know, but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad

Went home to sleep

We ran away for a while
Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart in you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars

Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting drifting drifting drifting

And imagined I was yours and you were mine

The floor most every night

'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

What it feels like for a girl

Silky
Smooth lips as sweet as candy
Baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls
They never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak could you be a little weak

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently
Baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show and tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best could you be a little less

Because I had rhythm, music, love,

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,

But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]

There's one thing you miss, and that's

Gives your hosiery a fright

But when darkness hits the town
And there's washing on your line
Get your knickers down
Before the dreaded sign
When the clock strikes eight
And you're snuggled up in bed
He'll be at the garden gate
Filling underwear with dread

Gone to stay with some mates

And I hate to leave her lonely
Ring ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, let's hit Japan
If we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand
Spend it in the south of France
Nothing further, I jumped
Grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to 'Walk it Out' like Unk
In my John Lennon chucks
That's when I heard Murder
You're killin me, you're fillin me
With sorrow, sunrise, goodbyes
And missin you tomorrow's

To dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher

Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat, and sleep
Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand
What I speak, but they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am, and they stand, and they clap
They applaud. They love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint Henri, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been
And, everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, um

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed ya
In my dreams fore I went to sleep to lala land to count them sheep
I swear you're lookin' prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more
For better or, less or poor, or worth our weight in buried treasure

When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

You don't love me quite so fiercely now

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost"

Into the masterpiece
And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked
A thousand kisses deep

I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep
And quiet is the thought of you
The file on you complete
Except what we forgot to do

The wretched and the meek

And I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
Where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
All of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 

Just take a look at your body now, 
There's nothing much to save 
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 

Now if you can manage to get 
Your trembling fingers to behave, 
Why don't you try unwrapping 
A stainless steel razor blade? 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

There's no hot water 
And the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
The kind of places you've been living in? 

Don't drink from that cup, 
It's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
That is your vision growing dim. 

Cover up your face with soap, there, 
Now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
Who will give you his applause. 

I thought you were a racing man, 
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
And it's stopping at your face. 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
And a girl with chestnut hair, 
And you passed the summers 
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman, 
Oh, there were times she was just a child, 
And you held her in the shadows 
Where the raspberries grow wild. 

And you climbed the twilight mountains 
And you sang about the view, 
And everywhere that you wandered 
Love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
Yes it makes you clench your fist. 

And then the veins stand out like highways, 
All along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
It's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
Go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
There are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
They can give you back your hope, 
You can find your love with diagrams 
On a plain brown envelope. 

But you've used up all your coupons 
Except the one that seems 
To be written on your wrist 
Along with several thousand dreams. 

Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses 
And he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan, 
The stand in stunt man,

It's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
You know this dress rehearsal rag,

The quiet one with good intentions
He was down with his brother, respectful

But good don't get attention

One kid with the promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Reading books 'bout science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool

Well he's not invisible anymore
With his father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime time news

Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole Oh Oh, now we'll never know

They're crying to the camera
Said he never fitted in, he wasn't welcome
He'd show up to the parties we was hanging in
Some guys were putting him down, bullin' him 'round

Now I wish I would have talked to him
Gave him the time of day, not turn away

If I would've then it wouldn't maybe go this far
He'd might'a stayed at home playing
angry  chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door

Our parents would be beaten for
Leave the breast
And then the rest
And then regret you ever left.

Is another open door.

All we ever look for, another womb.
All we ever look for, our own tomb.
All we ever look for, ooh, la lune.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you, too.
All we ever look for,
But we never do score.

All we ever look for, a god.
All we ever look for, oh, a drug.
All we ever look for, a great big hug.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you, too.

There's something very special indeed, 
In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy. 
There's something very real in how I feel, honey. 

[Chorus]
It's in me. 
It's in me, 
And you know it's for real. 
Tuning in on your saxophone. 

The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing 
Shadows on your saxophone, a surly lady in tremor. 
The stars that climb from her bowels, 
Those stars make towers on vowels. 

You'll never know that you had all of me. 
You'll never know the poetry you've stirred in me. 
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly, 
I've never known or felt in myself so rightly,

It's seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best

When you were under the gun, that's right
I know. I've seen this place before
But it's never been so fun
Never been so fun

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost

Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love, try to see me grow
I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny, these words when they're true
I'm on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me

Oh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'
Your tongue is like a weapon
This is cappin' from heaven and yet so are ye's

Since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
With glowing skeleton bones

In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style on diamond to fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed then you soon on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone,
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

What's gonna make you fall in love

Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone with me."

Not the top, not the bottom, but the middle
And I still remember where I cracked my head
In the vacant lot, there's a row of tiny houses there now 
And we used to light fires in the gutters
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
But the girl down the street hit my sister on the head
With a stick and we hid behind my father
As he knocked on the parents' door
To tell the them what she did
But the parents were drunk so they really didn't give a shit

And the girl down the street said a dog couldn't bark
'Cause a man with an axe cut its voicebox out
But my older sister told me that it prob'ly wasn't true
And I believe what she said 'cause she took me by the hand
One time when a coupla men drove down the hill in a white van
Said there was a phone box filled with money 'round the corner
And I woulda gone along but she took me by the hand
To the house in the middle of the hill
In the middle of the hill, in the middle of the hill

And my mother knew the words to a lot of different songs
And we'd always sing the harmonies, yeah we'd sing along
She had cold, cold hands when the fever hit
And then the noises that the trains made sounded like people in my head
And the stories that the ceiling told 
Through the pictures and the grains in the pine-wood boards
And let me stay outside 'til the sky went red

And it feels like home

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm

She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels

Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

In a suburban room

""Do you want to dance?""
""I love to dance""

Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head

Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead

In his face, oh

Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out through the pain
But the statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, ah

Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him

A course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard
Through midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child
Needing love and understanding

What a strange, strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
Couldn't bring him to maturity

He keeps referring back to school days
And clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient
Well I failed
""Grow up!"" I cried
And as, the smoke was clearing he said
""Give me one good reason why!""

Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side

What a strange, strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

A thousand glass eyes were staring
In a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring
Under crisp white sheets of curfew
We were newly lovers then
We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules"

To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, ""Have children!""
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want right now
Is, find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by"

Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbor town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away

Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest

He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam Of a broken promise in the bay

(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)

He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday

(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)

I was at sea then
I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace

(Then came another ""goodbye"" and another ""Please don't go"")

And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace

(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)

I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place

(Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know)

And hates the sound that goodbyes make
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her

She swears that there's no difference
Between the lies and compliments
It's all the same if everybody leaves her

And every magazine tells her she's not good enough
The pictures that she sees make her cry

She would change everything, everything, just ask her
Caught in the in-between a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home

She's given boys what they want
And tries to act nonchalant
Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction

She never stays the same for long
Assuming that she'll get it wrong
Perfect only in her imperfection

She's not a drama queen
She doesn't want to feel this way
Only seventeen, but tired

She would change everything, everything, just ask her
Caught in the in-between a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home

She's just the way she is, but no one's told her that's okay

She would change everything, everything, just ask her

She would change everything for happy ever after

Can't hear your daddy's warning cry.
You're going back to be all the things you want to be
While in sweet dreams you softly sigh.

You hear my voice is calling to be mine again,
Live the rest of your life in a day.
Get out and get what you can
While your mummy's at home a-sleeping.
No time to understand
'Cause they've lost what they thought they were keeping.

No one can hear us in your sweet dream,
Don't hear you leave to start the car.
All wrapped up tightly in the coat you borrowed from me,
Your place of resting is not far.
You hear my voice is calling to be mine again,
Live the rest of your life in a day.
Get out and get what you can
While your mummy's at home a-sleeping.

I will give you good cheer.

If you wait then your plate I will fill.
As the verses unfold and your soul
Suffers the long day

And the twelve o'clock gloom
Spins the room, you struggle on your way,
Well, don't you sigh, don't you cry,
Lick the dust from your eye.

We'll meet in the sweet light of dawn.
As the Baker Street train spills your pain
All over your new dress
And the symphony sounds underground

Puts you under duress,
Well, don't you squeal as the heel
Grinds you under the wheels.

Life's a long song,
Life's a long song,

You were kissed by a witch one night in the wood,
And later insisted your feelings were true.
The witch's promise was coming,
Believing he listened while laughing you flew.

Leaves falling red, yellow, brown, all are the same,
And the love you have found lay outside in the rain.
Washed clean by the water but nursing its pain.
The witch's promise was coming, and you're looking
Elsewhere for your own selfish gain.

Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be,
Well, you're wasting your time, they're not stupid like he is.
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see.

You won't find it easy now, it's only fair.
He was willing to give to you, you didn't care.
You're waiting for more but you've already had your share.
The witch's promise is turning, so don't you wait up
For him, he's going to be late."

Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Traveling a street that I did not go
Lifetime to the winter load
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Woah, I am one
Woah, I am one

But first I gotta make my rise
Baby slow down
My crib`s on the other side of town
But from the look in her eyes
She was hypnotized
Rubbed her hands on my chest
And started getting undressed
Tell me why

Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you`re really feelin` me
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked
Tell me why you just can`t stop
I`m thinking that it`s all about me
What could it be?

I got the sixty inch flat tv, what?
Got it like DVD, whatever you need
I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub)
Silk sheets baby to make love
Oh girl I want to hit it in the worst way
After that you`ll be coming back like every day
Oh yeah send you back to your girls with something else to say
How I hit it, split it, had you with it till the break of day

Could it be the drop top Benz
That got your friends going out on a limb
Sliding me numbers when you ain`t watching them
Playing me close but I`m not feeling them
Could it be the time piece flooded with chips?
You with me cause I flex brigets around my wrist?
Or large amounts up in my bank account
You tell me you love me baby but what`s that all about

Gets deeper

When you're specially designed for crash testing
Or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove

'Cause it's a battle when you dabble in war
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
Whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care

Just cash in your blanks for little toy tanks
Learn how to use them, then abuse them and choose them
Over conversations relationships are overrated
I hated everyone said the sun

And so I will cook all your books
You're too good looking and mistooken
You could watch it instead
From the comfort of your burning beds
Or you can sleep through the static

Who needs sleep when we've got love?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came

Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brut force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do

We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy

Well mighty mighty appetite
We just eat 'em up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see

But who needs to see what we've done?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
Beyond where we should have gone
We went beyond where we should have gone
Beyond where we should have gone"

Hearts and bones from days of youth,

Released from circles guarded tight,

I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
And when I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face
Yeah but Ill tell you
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
(by grace, my sight grows stronger)
And I do not feel the romance I will not be
(and I will not be a pawn for the prince of darkness any longer)

Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
Oh the cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heavens ceiling
And he almost pulled me under

Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine

Of my vessel
I marvel at the stars
And feel my heart overflow

Further down the river

Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
Floating down a river named emotion
Will I make it back to shore?
Or drift into the unknown

Further down the river

I'm building an antenna
Transmissions will be sent
When I am through
Maybe we can meet again
Further down the river
And share what we both discovered
Then revel in the view

Further down the river

I'm floating down a river"

I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone,

A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone.

Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again,
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends,
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin,
I'm twenty stories up, yeah I'm up at the top,
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,
I bet my momma found my letter, now shes calling the cops,
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,
I never bought a suit before in my life,
But when you go to meet god, you know you wanna look nice.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,

A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

We hit the sky, there goes the light,
No more sun, why's it always night
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,
When you can't dream, well, whats life mean?
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die,
A Mother and a Son and someone you know,
Smile at each other and realize you don't,
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,
Now Momma feels guilt, yea Momma feels pain,
When you were young, you never thought you'd die,
Found that you could but too scared to try,
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,
Like a bird so high,
Oh I might just try,
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,

Oh I might just try,
Oh I might just try."

What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more
Okay honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

I am the morning DJ on KHJ

I christened my guitar
As my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra
In my room I'd practice late
They'd leave me alone
My mother said, ""You're nothing yet
To make the folks write home""

I'd play at all the talent nights
I'd finish, they'd applaud
Some called it muffled laughter
I just figured they were odd
So I went up for an encore
But they screamed they'd had enough
Or maybe I just need a group
To help me do my stuff

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance
Some strings would sound so fine

And we would play together
Like fine musicians should
And it would sound like music
And the music would sound good

That same old formula

Oh, I write love songs for my favorite girl
And sing them soft and slow
But before I get to finish
She says she has to go
She's nice and says ""Excuse me
I've got to find a bar
I think I need refreshment
For I hear you play guitar""

Oh I sent a demo tape I made
To the record companies
Two came back address unknown
One came back C.O.D
Of course I got form letters
All saying pleasant things
Like suggesting I should find a trade
Where I would not have to sing

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in

I've been taking guitar lessons
But my teacher just took leave
It was something about a break down
Or needing a reprieve
I know I found my future
So I will persevere
And hold onto my dream of
Making music to their ears

And so I'd dream a bass will join me

He put colors all over the paper

And the teacher said.. What you doin' young man
I'm paintin' flowers he said
She said,
It's not the time for art young man
And anyway flowers are green and red
There's a time for everything young man
And a way it should be done
You've got to show concern for everyone else
For you're not the only one

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

But the little boy said
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

Well the teacher said
You're sassy
There's ways that things should be
And you'll paint flowers the way they are
So repeat after me

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way

There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

The teacher put him in a corner
She said
It's for your own good
And you won't come out 'til you get it right
And all responding like you should
Well finally he got lonely
Frightened thoughts filled his head
And he went up to the teacher
And this is what he said, and he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

Time went by like it always does
And they moved to another town
And the little boy went to another school
And this is what he found
The teacher there was smilin'
She said
Painting should be fun
And there are so many colors in a flower
So let's use every one

But that little boy painted flowers
In neat rows of green and red
And when the teacher asked him why
This is what he said
And he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen."

On the road to find a higher high

All I need is my injection

I've been doin' gigs since I was ten
I really can't remember when
I ever had a dollar to my name
My ears are blown, my eyes are red
I got big holes inside my head
Snorting too much crystal and cocaine

I have bennies with the breakfast toast
Qualudes with the evening roast
Assorted snorts of powder in between
I don't think a day's gone by
That I wasn't drunk or high
It's the only way I keep my sanity

From Kegger's Den to Hooterville
My flaming tricks have topped the bill
A thousand empty bottles earn my name
Endless trains of one night stands
Sharing gigs with half-assed bands
And all the local groupies lay the same

Well I could have had a payin' job
Workin' for some fucked-up slob
Wife and family, true security
But I left that shit behind
For that heavy metal grind
'Cause rock'n roll is in my blood to stay

So please don't give me up

Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy

Take back your singing in the rain

Got out of the place

For the boys on MTV

Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again

But it feels like the road to hell

I took the knife as well

Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand

Do not make the man

May not be what you want from me

Voices that sing in waking moments

So you though you would run away 
But you know that way too well

A longer yesterday

Fade and fly into the sun"

To find what she was looking for
To identify, to really try
To  find herself  some hope
With the summer sun for laughing             
And the winter rain did pour
She was lovelier from learning
And from living, loving more
From her dancing love and young soul
And the gypsies in her dream
To the pulse of stark acceptance
When the winds began to freeze          
With no curfews left to hold her
And no walls to shield her pain
Finding out that facts were older
And that life forms are insane.
The presence of protection seemed
To fade, as did her doubt
That she now was no exception
Nor was the love who pushed her out
           
Though the streets cried out,
Go, homesick
Virtues strength of mind would ring
In the maladies of meaning
The sad song she learned to sing.
Now, her teachers and philosophers
And the poet's silver throat
Are the vessels which on wisdom's karmic  ocean she will float.
Was this her revolution,
Just a child in love's crusade,
With the question in her innocence
Through the lies her eyes betrayed?"

The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

I have been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courtin'
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday
As down the road I go

I've been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy

I call my friends and say, ""Let's go into town""
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town

Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?

You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more

You fell in love when I was only ten

Much has gone by since then

You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay

Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine

You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands held mine so few hours
(I fell into love)
And I'm not a child anymore

I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting? Yes
But then women usually are

I'm not a child anymore
No, I'm not a child, oh no
Tall enough to reach for the stars
I will do
As I'm told
Even if I never hold you again
I never hold you again

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts,
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done

Guess I'm still I love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I that the faults mine
'Cause I let him go
Tried to get over it but it's messing with my mind

Fails to mention I still hate you

Are loaded guns to our heads.

Until your breathing stops forever

Sometimes we take pills

You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you

I was the type to never want for nothing

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee 
And she's gone to Carter Hall as fast as go can she 

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two

""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child"" 

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame

I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have""

Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must buy 

So first let past the horses black and then let past the brown 
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down 

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town 
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown 

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake 
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father 

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold 
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child 

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight 
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight"" 

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring 
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win 

Then up spoke the Faery Queen, an angry queen was she 
Woe betide her ?ill-fought? face, an ill death may she die 

""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""what this knight I did see 
I have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree"""

Bet your life there's a riot tonight in the mess hall, listen

A letter from your home town makes you sad
You read it when the warden's had a second laugh
He said sentimental rubbish ain't got no place in here, boy

When a Molotov didn't do its stuff
You went back in there and said it with a sawed-off shotgun

Or crushed in the path of a moving elevator, elevator

They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars

His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!
You can't run from me Kim

You're only making this harder on yourself

Yeah, yeah

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw the line any fences
If so to what extent if at
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed super-man
Man how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic

I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
But who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs!

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

Why are you bein' so mean!?
You're a mean, mean man!

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening
OK now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this,
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany

So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up,
Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
That I could bust one take
Without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth OK
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open,
You're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch,
A bunch of sweets or somethin'
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin' through the gum
Your breath stinks,
Want to chew some gum?
(Yes I do sir what am I on?)
You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out
Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful
Mean things, is my own insecurities!

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror
Notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like stickin' a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin' this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say

Whining about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had,
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it man
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it

Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when they kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"

There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky

That I remember in my true love's eyes

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now"

Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself

And there's no chance that we'll work it out

And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everything's great but everything's short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I

Dear Susan, I know you love me so
But I want to hear it in my ear.
You know I'd be there working at my craft
Had it not been for the draft.

You're here with me like I'm there with you.

The smell of the rain on the greenery.
Our fathers have painfully lost their way,
That's why, my love, I'm here today
Hear me when I say there will come a day
When Kings will know and love can grow.

Josie, I won't fail ya,
I won't fail you, have no fear.
Josie, I won't fail ya,
Give me one more chance, the day is near.
The meadows they are bursting,
The yellow corn lies in your hand.
And with the night comes sorrow
As the tide of dawn sleeps on the land.
The long breezes are blowing
All down the sky into my face.
I've a weary kind of feeling,
Like my time has come and gone to waste.
I love you, darling Josie,
The trees of pine they grow so tall.
How come you came to love me,
When you didn't love me at all?
Josie I won't fail ya,
I won't fail you, have no fear.
Josie I won't fail ya,
Give me one more chance, the day is near.
My Josie looks a child now,
As she lies here on my breast.
In the night I think about her,
In the day I get no rest.
I cut me a young pine-cone
And I gave it to the river deep.
It sailed 'way by your window
Where you lay, so long in sleep.
God bless you, darling Josie,
With your sparklin' eyes so bright and clear.
Josie, I won't fail ya,
I won't fail you, have no fear.

Looking' over cross eyed had a big
Hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the way side
Looking for the high tide
What will I find will I find will I find
All I saw was a man that had a hat
That had a pom-pom he's been there for
Years can someone tell me how long

Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me
What I could not find

You see this woman woke me up
At a quarter to three and I didn't 
Know it then but she put a spell on
Me said I had to go down to where
The cliffs meet the sea and meet an 
Old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my
Blindside to find an old man with a 
Lime and a kind eye
Mister, mister with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me
Just where I'm going
He pointed to a conk shell and then 
To the lime and said this is all
I really need to get by

Chorus

Hey mister man
I know you don't know
Who you think I think I am
But I can safely say, that I
Should've been sleeping the day
Away I said scuse me, you got the
Time he shrugged his shoulders
Said get a spine
Coconut hit me on the head
Jonesin' for a fig
I booked last night
I need another fix
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle
In the old man's eye and a wave
Tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound
It landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the 
Bottle down
Inside was the antidote to the spell
I read it to the man 'cause he 
Couldn't read so well
Said don't worry about a 
Thing you know you
Path is true just ease your
Mind have a banana
Or two

Goodness, goodness, woe is me
The man nearly flipped to lean 
That he was free but just before we 
Left and started kicking it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it

If that woman comes to you with 
Her song so sweet, say damn
Let the poor sucker sleep"

Of threats and bribes
In a hopeless porn parade

Life gets in the way
So we get loaded or totally legless

And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do

It feels so right
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

Turning circles when time again
It cuts like a knife oh yeah
If you love me got to know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time

Than sweet sweet lies
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul

And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love had better last
This years love had better last

'Cause whose to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on

For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears"

No need to know what you're doing or waiting for
But if ever anyone should ask

Tell them, I've been licking coconut skins,
And we've been hanging out.
Tell them, God just dropped by to forgive our sins,
And relieve us our doubt.

And I'm here to give you all a heavy heavenly dose.
I think you better listen 'cause I know who you are,
And I think that you should treat me like a superstar,
Because I'm more than just a human I'm the gift to all of you,
And I'm here to make sure that my message gets through.
I wonder if you're really all as dumb as you look,
Or are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book.
I hope you understand that the knowledge I bring,
Puts me in the position of a god or a king,
'Cause I'm blessed with the gift of the magic touch,
And I wouldn't say that I'm asking for too much.
All you have to do is get down on your knees and pray,
And I promise you the remedy is on its way,
But you can never be like me so don't waste your time,
Because I reign supreme and my position is divine.

What's wrong with being self-possessed?
Nobody satisfied with being second best.
I've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed,
And I've got to get it off my chest.
I'm the biggest, 
The best,
Better than the rest,

Better than the rest,

I'm the biggest, 
The best,
Better than the rest,
Better than the rest.

I'm not afraid of competition cause I know that I'm best,
And you haven't got a chance to even pass my little test.
Even if you wanted to you couldn't pay the price.
There ain't no room for losers in my perfect paradise,
'Cause life is always based upon the weight of your success,
So I'll make sure that I get the most and nothing less,
If I love myself then everyone will love me too,
And there's nothing you can do for me that I can't do.

What's wrong with being self-possessed?

So welcome to my kingdom and enjoy your little stay,
Even if you can't afford it I'll still make you pay.
So you better come and get it and enjoy it while you can,
Don't tell me that you're dumb enough to think I give a damn.
I couldn't care less about what you achieve,
And there's only one thing that you have to believe:
The only thing important that you have to understand,
Is that no matter what you say it's still a god I really am.

I'm the biggest, 
The best,
Better than the rest,

We've lost it all

She has won
Now its no fun
We've lost it all

I feel like our world's been infected,
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our life's been changed

And though we tried
Oh how we cried
We lost ourselves
The love has died

And though we tried
You can't deny
We're left as shells
We lost the fight

And we were sweet
But you chose lust when you deceived me
And you'll regret it, but it's too late

Hey, oh oh, hey

He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss

Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said hey mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)
It's pure infatuation
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)
Hey

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
I'm giving in
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me
Finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles (when he smiles)
I feel like a little child
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)
It's pure infatuation

Caught between my mama's words
And what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world
But a part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight
Ooh, hey

You adore me, never be lonely, oh

All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance,
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt
Then the congregation all stood up
And sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag

And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could've been
And then guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know

Won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time
Won't you rescue me?

But I think we have to walk
Keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning the lights on
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
And everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper
Have no phone conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
When I start polishing in the evening
By the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to live
Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
But what I tell you in the evening
By the morning won't make sense

You looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Only say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one kid
I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning it's such a drag

Got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I'll try to do the same
Well we might die from that medicine
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
What started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is
It was simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated"

Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours was the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I'd thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realized that need you
And I wondered if I could come home

I remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you just woke up

And you said
""This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides, maybe this time is different
I mean, I really think you like me"

What we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair
Or someone breakin' your heart
For twelve years I've held it all together
But a night like this is beggin' to pull me apart
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking
That I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you
Like only a best friend could

Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

As if it happening wasn't enough
I got to go and write a song
Just to remind myself how bad it sucked
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
Wrote a message on my pillow that says
""Jesse, stay asleep in bed""
Don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)
Search your cell for something which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray
If you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say
When your whole life has gone to Hell!

Tell me what you got away with
Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish
I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seat belt
And again when your head goes through the windshield

Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say ""best friends"" means friends forever

Is that what you call a getaway?!!
Tell me what you got away with!!
Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish!!
I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids!!

Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle

Out here needin' public housing
Out here trying to make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet

See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'

Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse

Cause I'm nine-to-five
And even puttin' overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' up, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' the cops clocked on the night-shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stay dedicated to the music we made yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug
Leave alone, came back the next year
Number one platinum song it blew up from the go
And what do you know (Oh no)
Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gon' wrong
Especially Bone, it never been right
I knew it would of been on
We would of been tight
We would of been in the zone ridin' so high
Up in the game fire, does, lie
See we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it (Right)
But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now
They got me trippin' ready to flip
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips
They got me trippin' loadin' the clips
They trippin', Lord I feel like I'm losin' it right

I'll never give up
I'll let 'em live in

They pretend to be tough (Pretend to be tough)
Pretend to be blessed
They want money and women, it's never enough
Hope nobody knows just too much
You better be good, you know up in the hood it's so,
We give 'em the dough
Fired out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake
On the television runnin' 'round tellin' niggas be ready for hate
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about guarding, guard the weak
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection
His date is probably
Probably my mommy, song
Cryin' for the life of you gone
Just me and my destiny let's roll, let's roll

[Wish]
When I lost my Uncle Charlie a part of me went wrong
And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong
We just wanted him to see what we do
You motivated us at the shows we see too
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You might have through somethin' hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
Crossed over, back to the hood we souljahs
The music nigga make it back, scandlous
But faith kicked in and the world shows and we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' fool in my baby's mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you want to flip
Suin' people things you would've never made on your own
Now I want to stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood
Bye, think I'm home
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a buster if it ain't meant to be
Wit a little ooh wee, wit a little ooh wee
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs
Lord just guide em' home, guide 'em home

Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinking to my self that this might be a waste of my time

Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason
Now I'm tweaking, then I tried to walk but I was slow

My nigga just call up the homey to hook us up on that liquid G
And if these hoes don't want to see, they gotta check the spot quickly
I'm feeling way high, but I'm also feeling way low
But damn I'm stuck in between
Fucking with broad boys and never get used
Just help, just throw in a few more

I started to see the devil, nigga was floating in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothing so I'm breaking
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
I'm looking at my home girl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumbling
And I was trying to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumbling
Fall off into something, but I guess I'm on a mission
Telling my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listening
Whistling, hanging out the window, need me some indo
'Till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm running a secret cous', 'cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers

I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy (Come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fucking with that ecstasy

I've been smoking weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (Brain)
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (Weed gets me high)
""Nigga try this here,"" they said ""better then that there""
They say, ""ya like it (ya like it)"" so I tried it (I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny
I'm high, but I'm too high, I want to hurt somebody
Nigga you tripping, get a hold of that shit, and ride that high
But I'm tripping, body moves, won't nobody get hurt (Hurt)

Get the wheel so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way

My friend Jerry Vandergrift kissed me in Home Ec. class
Later in the afternoon some jarheads in the locker room kicked my ass
I said guys I'm like you I like Monster Trucks too

Want to see how many push-ups I can do?
I just wish I was queer so I could get chicks
Chicks dig guys that are
Queer guys that don't dig

Chicks that don't dig guys like me
See I'm not queer I'm too ugly
But if I were handsome just imagine how great it would be
Incognito as gay though but not actually that way though pseudo homo

Phony
Maybe it's a stupid theory or maybe just stupidity
But if I was a queerbee in the fashion industry
Scoring with a super model would be easy

'Cause 'super model' means voluptuous but is also is synonymous with
'Super dumb'
Ya see I'd be a good listener so she'd treat me like a sister and soon
I'd become

That trusted friend that cares that rubs her back and braids her hair
No it wouldn't be a week before I'm in her underwear
I wish I was queer so I could get chicks

Queer guys that don't dig
Chicks that don't dig guys like me
See I'm not queer I'm too ugly
Doesn't matter what I'm packin' in my denim it's what's in my genes

The only smoked meat the only sausage I would eat is made by Jimmy
Dean
See I'm not to keen on the smell of Vaseline
No I'm not Princess Di and I don't want to be a queen

I wish I was queer so I could get chicks
Anyway if I were gay I'd have to change my name to Dirk or Lewis
Hang out with my mom's hair stylist his name is Kip he's got a lisp he
Talks like this

And wear my mother's lingerie learn the songs of Broadway
And appreciate Depeche Mode and avant garde ballet
I wish I was queer so I could get chicks

Your tainted heart, my tainted love, repent now

The world will go around

He was a friend of mine, he was a son of god ... he was a son of a gun

23 seconds, in you I see a chance
23 magic, if you change the name of love

Your crazy heart, my crazy love, repent now

They even tried bribery
I could have anything
As long as I said it out loud

Life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it

Of course this episode didn't last forever
I'd made my point and it was time to move on
To peel away the next layer of deceit
And see what new surprises lay in store
My school report said I showed no interest
""A disruptive influence""
I felt sorry for them in a way
And when they finally expelled me
It didn't mean a thing

The November day when I came home
The Christmas decorations were already up
Spray on snow, coloured flashing lights
And an artificial tree that played Silent Night
Over and over again
My parents welcomed me with loving arms
But within an hour were back at each others throats
Normal, happy childhood back on course
Batteries not included

Until I have a heart attack

I can't wait 'till we're alone at last
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance
To hold you in my arms at last

I'll never let it die

But she kept calling me insecure
I tried to quit but there's no use
Cause I'm addicted to her abuse
She's in control of everything
I'm just a puppet, she pulls my strings
Denying truth, I'll test my fate
And keep on playing this wicked game

Frozen from the winter's cold

Of the United States of Calamity, hey!
After all that you've done boy, I'm sure you're going to pay 

In the morning you come to the ladies salon
To get all fitted out for The Paperback Throne
But the people are living far away from the place
Where you wanted to help, it's a bit of a waste

And the puzzle will last till somebody will say
""There's a lot to be done while your head is still young""
If you put down your pen, leave your worries behind
Then the moment will come, and the memory will shine

Now the trouble is over, everybody got paid
Everybody is happy, they are glad that they came
Then you go to the place where you've finally found
You can look at yourself sleep the clock around"

Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameter
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs

Ben Franklin with the kite, getting over with the key
Now rock, shocking the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell the spell all of the old fables
'Cause I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An MC to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the drags of the earth and the eggs that I eat
I got pegs through my hands and one through my feet

Kicked out of the Palladium, d'you think that I care?

Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' the B-sized D-cup

Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went bezerk and worked, and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated

Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration

I smell weak 'cause y'all keep poppin' it

The fountain of youth, not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor

'Cause I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a peace of toast
I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes

I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations

I've tried to hear, you're not near.
Remembering when I saw your face,
Shining my way, pure timing.
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep,
It's killing me, I'm dying.

To put a little sunshine in your life.

Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me.
Soleil all over you
Warm sun.

Now this slick fallen rift,
Came like a gift,
Your body moves ever nearer
And your will dry this tear

Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain,
Then it's replaced, sun setting

And suddenly we're in love with everything.

I was weak with fear that
Something would go wrong,

I took all possibility from you

Conjuring her deepest fears
(come here you fucking bitch)

Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it

Never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on,

With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time

Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times

Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it eat it eat it

Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs

Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs

But I didn't stop cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name

We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life
Love
Stress
And set backs
Yes
You could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scares to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of life
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cause I miss you

I'm shook
I know
I pushed when I should of pulled
Took it all back if I could I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I hits a couple of snags
That remind me of the past
I cant front I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long its gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Gimme your opinions I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant
Make a visit
Ill wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it"

Not really something to shout about.
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are swingin' from the power lines,
Nobody's home, so nobody minds.

I woke up on the darkest night,
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light.
(We found the light)
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small.

I went out into the night.
I went out to pick a fight with anyone.
Light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.
Growin' up in some strange storm,
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are dyin' out in the snow,
Look at them go, look at them go!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.

What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide.
Just light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Cause nothin's hid, from us kids!
You ain't foolin' nobody with the lights out!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.
And there's something wrong in the heart of man,
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!

Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

Rolling down Rodeo Drive
She got her daddy's black Corniche
And her tennis pro by her side

And she wants her mother's lover
To exercise her skill
And if she don't score him fast
She knows that her brother will

Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills

She says that she's an actress
Just never got a part
Now she's a teenage mess
With a burned out Gucci heart

She cracked one day at Cartier
When things came to a head
They put her trinkets away
And wrapped her up instead

Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills

She bit like a dog and she screamed like hell
""You ain't taking me to no padded cell
You better take all your hands off my high priced tail""

Your nightgown on the stairs
I remember every night
Scenes from home in the Quiet Room

How long have I been gone
Did winter kill the lawn
And all those polaroids you sent
Are on the wall in the Quiet Room

They've got this place
Where they've been keeping me
Where I can't hurt myself
I can't get my wrists to bleed
Just don't know why 
Suicide appeals to me

The Quiet Room
Is sterilized and white
It's like a tomb
With just a moth stained naked night

Plastic forks and spoon
No laces in my shoes
They allknow what I tried to do
Outside the Quiet Room

This quiet place
It ain't so new to me
It's haunted atmosphere
Has heard so many scream
My home from home
My twilight zone
My strangest dream

My confidant 
I have confessed my life 
The Quiet Room 
Knows more about me than my wife

They've got this place
Where they've been keeping me
Where I can't hurt myself
I just can't
I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed

A mattress on the floor
No handles on the door
I really need nothing here
I'm alone"

Will we ever get better
Will we stay the same
Billie I'm worried

Millie don't worry
No one knows our pain
Being in love is crazy not alone that way
I know you're worried today

God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone

Billie my mind seems to wander
To events of a night long ago
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed
In the trunk of your '68 Olds

Millie our world's an asylum
And our minds like you say ain't that straight
But you know and I know our passion's
Not deformed it's true to say
We'll love our lifetime

God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone

Billie I dream of our children
They're frightening and gruesome and sad
And I don't want them growing inside me
They're no price for the love that we have

Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane
Oh Millie oh Billie

Oh Billie it's fresh in my memory
The night that it had to be done
You with your pick axe and scissors
And you with your shovel and gun

And I liked your late husband Donald
But such torture his memory brings
All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies
Guess love makes you do funny things

Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane
Oh Millie oh Billie"

We just burned down the church
While the choir within sang religious songs
And it's not like we thought we was right
We just played with the wheels of a passenger train
That cracked on the tracks one night
It's not like we ain't on the ball
We just talk to our shrinks
Huh, they talk to their shrinks
No wonder we're up the wall
We're not stupid or dumb
We're the lunatic fringe who rusted the hinge
On Uncle Sam's daughters and sons
Good old boys and girls
Congregating, waiting in another world
With roller coaster brains
Imagine playing with trains
Good old boys and girls
Congregating, waiting in some other world
We're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy
Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks
And don't think we're trying to be bad
All the innocent crime seemed alright at the time
Not necessarily mad, not necessarily mad
We watch every day for the bus
And the driver would say
""That's where lunatics stay""
I wonder if he's talking about us
It's not like we're vicious or gone
We just dug up the graves where your relatives lay
In old forest lawn
And it's not like we don't know the score
We're the fragile elite they dragged off the street
I guess they just couldn't take us no more

I got my scriptures and my wires crossed
I got no kids, and I got no home
They want us holy men to live alone

Since I've been here for a little stay
I see Rozetta day by day
She turns my head, makes me cough
I want to tear my collar off

I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light
Shining in her eyes

Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice
When underneath I was a regular guy
My pulpit melted like a block of ice
When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky

From my stretcher, when they wheeled me in
I stared directly in the eyes of sin
Nurse Rozetta, standing over me
And I was helpless as a man of God could be

Nurse Rozetta; I won't let her
Catch me peering down her sweater
Fantasizing silk suspender on her thighs
Nurse Rozetta make me better

Secretly my eyes undress her
Let me feel your tongue depressor
I'm suddenly twice my size
My pants are all wet inside

She's so creative with a bar of soap
And so inventive with a stethoscope
To check my pulse, she gotta hold my hand
I blow the fuse on the encephalogram

Satan sent her from the bowels of hell
I should have recognized old Jezebel
I surrendered to the urges felt
She popped the buckle on my bible belt

I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light
Shining in her eyes

I'd lick her nylon seams
Like a hungry cat with cream
Oh, what a vivid seam
And I can't hold back no more"

And have time to play

I'll have a spring in my step
And I'll get there soon

And you better bring a change of clothes
So we can sail our laughing pianos along a beam of light
But I'm quite alright
